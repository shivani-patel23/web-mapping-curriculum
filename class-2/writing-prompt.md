For your class journal:

What is the difference between raster and vector data?
As raster tiles are images stitched together, they can be zoomed and panned but do not provide styling capabilities on user's end. Raster tiles have fixed styles, defined at the time they are created. Vector tiles can be styled dynamically when the user wants. Rasters are pixels and vector are made up of points,lines and polygons.

Why do "slippy maps" exist?
which dynamically requests maps from a server in the background (without reloading the whole HTML page) to give a smooth slippy zoomy map browsing experience. The implementation of this is provided by a javascript library, either OpenLayers or Leaflet. The map image is built up of many little square images called "tiles". These are rendered and served from a "tile server".
Why would you want to install a dedicated text editor?
they help identify the errors in your code and also help identify different parts of the code. ie header, style, source, layers etc. 

What is Leaflet?
a dinosaur :) 
eaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. Weighing just about 38 KB of JS, it has all the mapping features most developers ever need.
Leaflet is designed with simplicity, performance and usability in mind. It works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms, can be extended with lots of plugins, has a beautiful, easy to use and well-documented API and a simple, readable source code that is a joy to contribute to.

How has web map rendering changed over the years?
It has become more performant,and more customizable. 

What is the basemap-overlay paradigm and how are GL maps different?
A basemap overlay is like cheese on a hamburger, you can't really change layers, you are stacking the layers one over the other.GL maps allow you to take the different layers, sources, types, data etc.and display everything on the map in an interactive way.
